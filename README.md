This is my portfolio, it is a work in progress still. I have recently updated it with my first group project and some of my asignments!

The images are going to be links to the another page with description of the application as well as a link to the application.

Get In Contact section has links to each method of contact, email link will open default mail application and start a new email addressed to me.
